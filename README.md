To create a proper `README.md` file for your GitHub project, I need to review the contents of your uploaded PDF titled **"ML project pdf"**. I’ll extract the text and key information from the file and then generate a GitHub-friendly README.

Let me process the file first.


The project is titled **"Hotel Booking Prediction"**, a Machine Learning (ML) project likely submitted as a part of a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. Based on the initial content, I'll generate a `README.md` that includes standard sections such as project description, dataset, implementation details, and instructions for usage.

Here’s a GitHub-friendly `README.md` you can upload with your project:

# Hotel Booking Prediction

This is a Machine Learning project aimed at predicting hotel booking outcomes using various features such as booking dates, number of adults/children, room type, and more. It was developed as part of a B.Tech degree submission in the Department of Information Technology at CMREC (UGC Autonomous).

## Overview

Hotel booking prediction is a classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a booking will be honored or canceled. This model can be used by hotel chains to anticipate cancellations and optimize resource allocation.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various features like:
- Lead time
- Arrival date
- Meal type
- Country
- Market segment
- Assigned room type
- Booking status (target variable)

(You may specify if it's based on an open dataset like the one from Kaggle.)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Modeling Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized correlations and data distributions.
3. **Model Training**: Tested various models including:
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Logistic Regression
4. **Evaluation**: Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-booking-prediction.git
   cd hotel-booking-prediction
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Hotel_Booking_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

## Results

The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy of **\~XX%** (update based on actual results).
